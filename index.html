              JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time
              compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it
              is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many
              non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache
              CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based,
              multi-paradigm, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented,
              imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.
              Read more about JavaScript. This section is dedicated to the
              JavaScript language itself, and not the parts that are specific to
              Web pages or other host environments. For information about APIs
              specific to Web pages, please see Web APIs and DOM.

              The standard for JavaScript is ECMAScript. As of 2012, all modern
              browsers fully support ECMAScript 5.1. Older browsers support at
              least ECMAScript 3. On June 17, 2015, ECMA International published
              the sixth major version of ECMAScript, which is officially called
              ECMAScript 2015, and was initially referred to as ECMAScript 6 or
              ES6. Since then, ECMAScript standards are on yearly release
              cycles. This documentation refers to the latest draft version,
              which is currently ECMAScript 2020. Do not confuse JavaScript with
              the Java programming language. Both "Java" and "JavaScript" are
              trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and
              other countries. However, the two programming languages have very
              different syntax, semantics, and uses.

              HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup language that
              defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series
              of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of
              the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way.
              The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere
              else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller,
              and so on.
            </p>

            <p>
              The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this
              case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This
              states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this
              case where the paragraph begins. The closing tag: This is the same
              as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before
              the element name. This states where the element ends — in this
              case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one
              of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
              The content: This is the content of the element, which in this
              case, is just text. The element: The opening tag, the closing tag
              and the content together comprise the element.

              Like HTML, CSS is not really a programming language. It is not a
              markup language either — it is a style sheet language. This means
              that it lets you apply styles selectively to elements in HTML
              documents. We still need to apply the CSS to your HTML document.
              Otherwise, the CSS styling won't affect how your browser displays
              the HTML document.

            <p>
              The whole structure is called a rule set (but often "rule" for
              short). Note also the names of the individual parts: Selector The
              HTML element name at the start of the rule set. It selects the
              element(s) to be styled (in this case,
            </p>

            <p>
              elements). To style a different element, just change the selector.
              Declaration A single rule like color: red; specifying which of the
              element's properties you want to style. Properties Ways in which
              you can style a given HTML element. (In this case, color is a
              property of the
            </p>

            <p>
              elements.) In CSS, you choose which properties you want to affect
              in your rule. Property value To the right of the property after
              the colon, we have the property value, which chooses one out of
              many possible appearances for a given property (there are many
              color values besides red).

            <p>
              An object is a collection of related data and/or functionality
              (which usually consists of several variables and functions — which
              are called properties and methods when they are inside objects.)
              Let's work through an example to understand what they look like.
              To begin with, make a local copy of our oojs.html file. This
              contains very little a script element for us to write our source
              code into. We'll use this as a basis for exploring basic object
              syntax. While working with this example you should have your
              developer tools JavaScript console open and ready to type in some
              commands. As with many things in JavaScript, creating an object
              often begins with defining and initializing a variable.
            </p>

            <p>
              The value of an object member can be pretty much anything — in our
              person object we've got a string, a number, two arrays, and two
              functions. The first four items are data items, and are referred
              to as the object's properties. The last two items are functions
              that allow the object to do something with that data, and are
              referred to as the object's methods. An object like this is
              referred to as an object literal — we've literally written out the
              object contents as we've come to create it. This is in contrast to
              objects instantiated from classes, which we'll look at later on.
              It is very common to create an object using an object literal when
              you want to transfer a series of structured, related data items in
              some manner, for example sending a request to the server to be put
              into a database. Sending a single object is much more efficient
              than sending several items individually, and it is easier to work
              with than an array, when you want to identify individual items by
              name.

          <article>
            <p>
              JavaScript is often described as a prototype-based language — to
              provide inheritance, objects can have a prototype object, which
              acts as a template object that it inherits methods and properties
              from. An object's prototype object may also have a prototype
              object, which it inherits methods and properties from, and so on.
              This is often referred to as a prototype chain, and explains why
              different objects have properties and methods defined on other
              objects available to them. Well, to be exact, the properties and
              methods are defined on the prototype property on the Objects'
              constructor functions, not the object instances themselves. In
              JavaScript, a link is made between the object instance and its
              prototype (its __proto__ property, which is derived from the
              prototype property on the constructor), and the properties and
              methods are found by walking up the chain of prototypes.
